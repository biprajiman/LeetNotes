# Summary   
I have been practicing and interviewing over the years. I started this notes to keep track of some of the problems and summarize the core concept behind the problem (ideally multiple solutions including brute force and optimal). I have tried to categorize the problems into their own folders. I have also tried to provide an uncategorized list with problem catogory tag for quick glance. I have found random list with the tag more effective for me to understand and remember the problem.

# Problems Notes:
<<<<<<< HEAD
All the problems described here do not have implementation. Implementation is left for readers. I have selected few problems that are representative  and based on some of the core ideas. This list also summarizes problems and categories that I have struggled over the years (either to remember or recall). Notes are designed based on python implementation.

# Uncategorized list:
This [README](Uncategorized/README.md) here lists all the problems. I created uncategorized list for quick reference. Additionally this list is necessary because some of the problems could be solved using more than one concept and can fall in more than one category.

# Quick Note
This note is my way not forget the concepts I have studied or experienced during many failed interviews over the years. I started this for self practice and self help rather than guide for anyone else. If you have any feedback or suggestions please reach out. If you want to add or improve upon this, you are always welcome to contribute.
